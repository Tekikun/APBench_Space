Please provide the answer in degrees.. It has answer 28 A satellite is in a circular orbit with a radius of 6570 km and an inclination of 28°. It needs to be moved to a circular orbit with a radius of 42,160 km and an inclination of 0°. This scenario could be a satellite launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida headed for a geostationary orbit. What is the total burn required to move the satellite to the desired geostationary orbit? Please provide the total burn required in kilometers per second (km/s). Without any extra words, please specify the answer in the final sentence with this form: 'the answer is (answer)'.

      "reply:  The total burn required to move the satellite from its initial circular orbit with a radius of 6570 km and inclination of 28° to a geostationary orbit with a radius of 42,160 km and inclination of 0° is calculated by performing a Hohmann transfer and incorporating the inclination change at the apoapsis of the transfer orbit to minimize delta-v. The first burn to enter the transfer orbit is 2.461 km/s, and the second burn at apoapsis, which combines circularization and inclination change, is 1.825 km/s. The sum of these delta-v magnitudes is 4.286 km/s.\n",
