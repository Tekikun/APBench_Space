reply:  Here are the key parameters (using μMars = 4.2828×10^4 km^3/s^2 and RM = 3385 km):

1. Radii  
   r1 = 3385 + 17000 = 20385 km  
   r2 = 3385 + 30000 = 33385 km

2. Circular speeds  
   v1 = √(μ/r1) = √(42828/20385) = 1.449 km/s  
   v2 = √(μ/r2) = √(42828/33385) = 1.133 km/s

3. Transfer orbit  
   a = (r1 + r2)/2 = 26885 km  
   e = (r2 − r1)/(r2 + r1) = 13000/53770 ≈ 0.242  
   tp = π √(a^3/μ) = π √(26885^3/42828) ≈ 6.69×10^4 s ≈ 18.6 h

4. ΔV’s for Hohmann transfer  
   at periapsis (r1):  
     vp = √[μ(2/r1 − 1/a)] = 1.615 km/s  
     ΔV1 = vp − v1 = 1.615 − 1.449 = 0.166 km/s  
   at apoapsis (r2):  
     va = √[μ(2/r2 − 1/a)] = 0.986 km/s  
     ΔV2 = v2 − va = 1.133 − 0.986 = 0.147 km/s

Bonus: An 800 000 km “orbit” lies outside Mars’s Hill sphere (~100 000 km), so solar tides would strip the probe out.

reply:  Given  
r₁ = Rₘ + 17 000 = 3 385 + 17 000 = 20 385 km  
r₂ = Rₘ + 30 000 = 3 385 + 30 000 = 33 385 km  
μ = 4.2828×10⁴ km³/s²  

Semimajor axis of transfer orbit  
aₜ = (r₁ + r₂)/2 = (20 385 + 33 385)/2 = 26 885 km  

Eccentricity  
e = (r₂ – r₁)/(r₁ + r₂) = (33 385 – 20 385)/(53 770) ≃ 0.242  

Velocity in initial circular orbit  
v₁ = √(μ/r₁) ≃ √(4.2828×10⁴/20 385) = 1.449 km/s  

Perigee speed on transfer ellipse  
v_p = √[μ(2/r₁ – 1/aₜ)] ≃ √[4.2828×10⁴(2/20 385 – 1/26 885)] = 1.6158 km/s  

Δv₁ = v_p – v₁ = 1.6158 – 1.449 = 0.167 km/s  

Velocity in final circular orbit  
v₂ = √(μ/r₂) ≃ √(4.2828×10⁴/33 385) = 1.133 km/s  

Apogee speed on transfer ellipse  
v_a = √[μ(2/r₂ – 1/aₜ)] ≃ √[4.2828×10⁴(2/33 385 – 1/26 885)] = 0.986 km/s  

Δv₂ = v₂ – v_a = 1.133 – 0.986 = 0.147 km/s  

Transfer time  
t = π√(aₜ³/μ) = π√(26 885³/4.2828×10⁴) ≃ 6.693×10⁴ s ≃ 18.6 h

reply:  Given:  
Mars radius RM = dM/2 = 6770 km/2 = 3385 km  
R1 = RM + 17000 km = 20385 km  
R2 = RM + 30000 km = 33385 km  
μMars = 4.2828×10^4 km^3/s^2  

1. Circular speeds  
 v1 = √(μ/R1) = √(4.2828×10^4/20385) = 1.449 km/s  
 v2 = √(μ/R2) = √(4.2828×10^4/33385) = 1.133 km/s  

2. Transfer orbit  
 a = (R1 + R2)/2 = 26885 km  
 e = (R2 – R1)/(R1 + R2) = 0.2418  

3. Velocities on transfer ellipse  
 vp = √[μ(2/R1 – 1/a)] = 1.615 km/s  
 va = √[μ(2/R2 – 1/a)] = 0.987 km/s  

4. Δv’s  
 Δv1 = vp – v1 = 1.615 – 1.449 = 0.166 km/s = 166 m/s  
 Δv2 = v2 – va = 1.133 – 0.987 = 0.146 km/s = 146 m/s  

5. Transfer time  
 t = π√(a^3/μ) = π√(26885^3/4.2828×10^4) = 6.695×10^4 s = 18.6 h  

Bonus (sphere of influence):  
 rSOI = aMars·(mMars/MSun)^(2/5)

reply:  Given:  
Perijove radius after JOI:  
  rₚ = R_J + 4700 km = 71 500 km + 4 700 km = 76 200 km  
Post‐injection perijove speed (from part b, after the retro‐burn to capture into a 53 day orbit) yields an orbital energy  
  ε = vₚ²/2 − μ_J/rₚ  
and semimajor axis  
  a = −μ_J/(2 ε).  

Numerically (using the known 53 day capture orbit):  
  μ_J = 1.26686×10⁸ km³/s²  
  P = 53.5 days = 4.625×10⁶ s  
  a³ = μ_J P²/(4π²) ⇒ a ≃ 4.065×10⁶ km

Answer:  2.53755 radians
msg  The satellite in problem 4.13 has a true anomaly of 90 degrees.

Given:  
\[ t_0 = 0 \]  
\[ M_0 = 1.37113 \, \text{rad} \]  
\[ n = 0.000097202 \, \text{rad/s} \]

Equation (4.38),  
\[ M - M_0 = n \times (t - t_0) \]  
\[ M = M_0 + n \times (t - t_0) \]  
\[ M = 1.37113 + 0.000097202 \times (1200 - 0) \]  
\[ M = 2.53755 \]

METHOD #1, Low Accuracy:

Equation (4.42),

\[ v \approx M + 2 \times e \times \sin M + 1.25 \times e^2 \times \sin 2M \]  
\[ v \approx 2.53755 + 2 \times 0.1 \times \sin(2.53755) + 1.25 \times 0.1^2 \times \sin(2 \times 2.53755) \]  
\[ v \approx 2.53755 + 0.1957 + 2.6394 \]  
\[ v \approx 2.64034 = 151.2 \, \text{degrees} \]

METHOD #2, High Accuracy:

Equation (4.41),

\[ M = E - e \times \sin E \]  
\[ 2.53755 = E - 0.1 \times \sin E \]  
By iteration,  
\[ E = 2.58996 \, \text{radians} \]

Equation (4.40),

\[ \cos E = (e + \cos v) / (1 + e \cos v) \]  
Rearranging variables gives,  
\[ \cos v = (\cos E - e) / (1 - e \cos E) \]  
\[ v = \arccos[( \cos(2.58996) - 0.1 ) / (1 - 0.1 \times \cos(2.58996))] \]  
\[ v = 2.64034 = 151.3 \, \text{degrees} \] What is the mean anomaly of the satellite 20 minutes after the initial time? Please provide the mean anomaly in radians.

The satellite is traveling with its long axis perpendicular to the velocity vector and its drag coefficient is 2.67.

Without any extra words, please specify the answer in the final sentence with this form: 'the answer is (answer)'. The answer should either be numeric or symbolic (not words).
reply:  Using a circular‐orbit drag decay model,  
da/dt = –(ρ Cd A/m) v a  
and one rev takes T = 2πa/v, so  
Δa = da/dt·T = –2π ρ Cd A a²/m.  

With a = RE+400 km = 6.778×10⁶ m, A=8 m², Cd=2.67, m=1000 kg, ρ≈4×10⁻¹² kg/m³:  
Δa ≈ –2π·4×10⁻¹²·2.67·8·(6.778×10⁶)²/1000 ≈ –24.7 m per revolution.

reply:  Assumptions:
- Atmospheric density at 400 km, ρ = 5×10⁻¹² kg/m³  
- Orbital velocity, v = 7 677 m/s  
- Cylinder cross‐sectional area, A = diameter×length = 2 m×4 m = 8 m²  
- Drag coefficient, C_d = 2.67  
- Orbit radius, r = (6 371 km + 400 km) = 6.771×10⁶ m  

Drag force:
F_d = ½ ρ v² C_d A 
   = 0.5×5×10⁻¹²×(7 677)²×2.67×8 
   ≈ 3.15×10⁻³ N  

Energy lost per revolution:
ΔE = F_d×(2πr) 
   = 3.15×10⁻³×2π×6.771×10⁶ 
   ≈ 1.34×10⁵ J  

Orbital energy magnitude:
E_orb = ½ m v² 
      = 0.5×1000×(7 677)² 
      ≈ 2.95×10¹⁰ J  

Number of revolutions before deorbit:
N = E_orb / ΔE

Vₐ = sqrt[μ(2/r_GEO – 1/a_trans)] with a_trans = (r₁+r_GEO)/2, r₁=R_E+200 km, r_GEO=R_E+35786 km.  
Then  
ΔV_GEO = sqrt(Vₐ² + V_B² – 2 Vₐ V_B cos28°).  
Numerically, Vₐ≈1.598 km/s, V_B=3.0746 km/s, so ΔV_GEO≈1.826 km/s.

1. The hyperbolic excess velocity at departure. Please provide the answer in meters per second with one decimal place.. It has answer 3607.1 For the spacecraft in Problems 5.3 and 5.4, the following data is provided:
- Injection occurs from a 200 km parking orbit.
- Earth's velocity vector at departure is \( 25876.6X + 13759.5Y \) m/s.
- From problem 5.4, the spacecraft's velocity vector is \( 28906.2X + 15232.7Y + 1289.2Z \) m/s. Calculate the following:
2. The injection ΔV. Please provide the answer in meters per second (m/s) to one decimal place. Without any extra words, please specify the answer in the final sentence with this form: 'the answer is (answer)'. The answer should either be numeric or symbolic (not words).
reply:  ΔV = √(v∞² + 2μ/r) – √(μ/r)
where μ = 3.986×10^14 m³/s², r = (6378+200)×10³ m, v∞ = 3607.1 m/s

√(μ/r) = √[3.986e14 / 6.578e6] = 7785.6 m/s  
2μ/r = 2·3.986e14 / 6.578e6 = 1.212×10^8  ⇒  v∞² + 2μ/r = 1.342×10^8  
√(v∞² + 2μ/r) = 11585.7 m/s

Answer:  96.29°
msg  Given a semi-major axis of \( a = 6567 \text{ km} \) (in LEO) and \( e = 0 \), the orbit is sun-synchronous. This means the ascending node is traveling eastward at \( \frac{360^\circ}{365 \text{ days}} \). Therefore, we already have the RAAN rate of change:

\[
\dot{\Omega} = \frac{360^\circ}{365 \text{ days}}
\]

Convert to radians/second:

\[
\dot{\Omega} = \frac{360^\circ}{365 \text{ days}} \times \frac{\pi}{180^\circ} \times \frac{\text{day}}{24 \text{ hrs}} \times \frac{\text{hr}}{3600 \text{ sec}} = 1.992385 \times 10^{-7} \text{ rad/s}
\]

Using the formula:

\[
\dot{\Omega} = \left[ -\frac{3}{2} J_2 \left( \frac{R_e}{p_0} \right)^2 \cos i \right] \dot{n}
\]

Reorganize to solve for inclination \( i \):

\[
i = \cos^{-1}\left(-\frac{2 \dot{\Omega}}{3 J_2 \dot{n}} \left( \frac{p_0}{R_e} \right)^2 \right)
\]

Calculate the semi-latus rectum (with \( e = 0 \)):

\[
p_0 = a(1 - e^2) = a = 6567 \text{ km}
\]

Calculate mean motion \( n \):

\[
n = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a^3}} = 1.1868652 \times 10^{-3} \text{ rad/s}
\]

With these values, along with the \( J_2 \) value of \( 1.08263 \times 10^{-3} \) and Earth's radius equal to 6378 km, calculate the inclination:

\[
i = \cos^{-1} \left( \frac{2 (1.992385 \times 10^{-7} \text{ rad/s})}{3 (1.1868652 \times 10^{-3} \text{ rad/s}) (1.08263 \times 10^{-3})} \left( \frac{6567}{6378} \right)^2 \right)
\] What is the inclination of a sun-synchronous orbit given the semi-major axis \( a = 6567 \text{ km} \) and eccentricity \( e = 0 \)? Please provide the answer in degrees. Without any extra words, please specify the answer in the final sentence with this form: 'the answer is (answer)'. The answer should either be numeric or symbolic (not words).

Answer:  63.43°
msg  Much like example 2, we have one significant piece of information. In this problem, we have a Molniya orbit. This kind of orbit is designed to have an argument of perigee not change. So in other words:

\[
\dot{\omega} = 0
\]

We can compare this to the equation we know:

\[
\dot{\omega}_{j2} = \left[\frac{3}{2}J_{2}\left(\frac{R_{e}}{p_{0}}\right)^{2}\left(2-\frac{5}{2}\sin^{2}i\right)\right]\bar{n} = 0
\]

Luckily, many of our terms cancel:

\[
2-\frac{5}{2}\sin^{2}i = 0
\] What is the inclination needed for Molniya orbits? Please provide the answer in degrees with up to two decimal places. Without any extra words, please specify the answer in the final sentence with this form: 'the answer is (answer)'. The answer should either be numeric or symbolic (not words).

reply:  First burn (at perigee r₁ₚ = 6055 km):  
aₜ = (6055 + 21329)/2 = 13692 km  
v₁ₚ = 9.25 km/s  
vₜₚ = 10.13 km/s  
Δv₁ = vₜₚ − v₁ₚ = 0.88 km/s  

Second burn (at apogee rₐ₂ = 21329 km):  
vₜₐ = 2.88 km/s  
v₂ₐ = 3.35 km/s  
Δv₂ = v₂ₐ − vₜₐ = 0.47 km/s  

Total ΔV = Δv₁ + Δv₂ = 1.35 km/s
